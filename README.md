# PythonNavTableforAero
Nav table (python edition) for create aeronautics.

Idk they forced me to add this

Navigation table python edition for create aeronautics. Copies the Navigation table and its cool, basically gives you redstone outputs in each direction based on the engle of the ship and endpoint. Will be implemented in CC

Dont take credit for this, feel free to update or add your own funky business.
